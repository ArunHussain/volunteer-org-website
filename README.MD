This is a website to match volunteers with organisations and was part of my A level computer science coursework.
The website uses user information (both volunteers' and organisations') to match them together and was designed to help make volunteering easier and more desirable.

File structure:
* "find_a_volunteer_dir" is where the code for the majority of the webpages is written
* "find_a_volunteer" contains various settings Django uses to initialise and set up the website
* "users" contains code for user account creation
* "user_images" stores images user upload as part of the process of verifying their account
* "manage.py" is created by Django and runs Django admin tasks
* db.sqlite3 is the database used by the website to store all information such as user details and all matches
